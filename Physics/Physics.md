Fixed tick rate 120 hz 8.33ms

## Car

force/accel fixed curve
fixed mass
ignore mass
tire friction
 Ratio = SideSpeed/ SideSpeed + ForwardSpeed (0 forward 1 sideways)
SlideFriction = Curve(Ratio)
GroundFriction = GroundNormal.Z
Friction = SlideFriction * GroundFriction

Impulse Contraint * Friction

### Apply Force
 Forces are applied in height of Center of mass

#### Stability
surface normal
conact point
rolling torque to roll back
with wheel push car down 

### Wheel position
